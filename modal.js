//This Javascript Program is being used to send form Data from a bootstrap created from, to a modal created in bootsrap, that displays a completed message to the user. This Program helps to demonstrate the functionality of a would-be back end or server side functionality to the form that would store the input data, and return a message of completion


//in .parallax5, we will be adding a click event listener to a form submit button to then toggle the bootsrap modal to appear and display a completed for submission message



$('#myModal').modal(show);


//the modal will have a click event that causes it to close

//upon closing the modal, the form will dissapear, and the grid view project feed will expand to fill the space
